The Society of Asian Scientists and Engineers (SASE) Hackathon is an exciting event that brings together individuals from diverse backgrounds and skill sets to collaborate on innovative projects. Their hackathon provides a platform for participants to showcase their creativity, problem-solving abilities, and technical skills.
My experience in the SASE 2023 Hackathon with my team, "The Dawgsss", was quite an adventure, especially since we were in the beginner tier. We faced challenges and obstacles, and it lead to significant growth and learning experiences.

We presented our project in front of the judges. It was a culmination of hard work and a chance to demonstrate the unique aspects of our project. Even though we were in the beginner tier and faced front-end challenges as none of us had worked in that area before, our dedication shone through in our presentation.

While we may not have developed trhe most glamorous app ever, we certainly leared very much from this experience. This hackathon was not just about the competition; it was about personal and professional growth, and "The Dawgsss" embraced every moment of the journey.

Welcome to Dawgs Nutrition, a user-friendly software application designed to help individuals monitor their daily caloric intake and expenditure, ultimately allowing them to calculate their net calorie balance. This program empowers users to make informed decisions about their dietary and fitness goals by providing valuable insights into their daily calorie consumption and expenditure.

Key Features:

Macro Input: Users can input their daily macronutrient intake, including proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. This feature enables individuals to track not only their calorie intake but also the quality of their diet.

Calorie Calculation: The program automatically calculates the total calories consumed based on the entered macros. It uses the standard caloric values for each macronutrient (4 calories per gram for carbohydrates and protein, 9 calories per gram for fat) to provide an accurate calorie count.

Calories Burned Input: Users can input their physical activities, including exercises, workouts, and daily activities that result in calorie expenditure. This feature allows users to keep track of the calories they burn throughout the day.

Net Calorie Calculation: The program calculates the net calories for the day by subtracting the calories burned from the total calorie intake. This figure represents the user's actual caloric balance for the day.

Goal Setting: Users can set personalized calorie intake goals based on their macro intake, whether it's weight loss, maintenance, or muscle gain.

User Profiles: Users can create and customize profiles.
